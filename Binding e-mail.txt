Dear Sir / Madam,


I wondered if I could get my thesis bound at your premises. The specifications are as follows:


1. 2 soft-bound copies
2. Single sided 134 pages
3. Available as a pdf
4. Medium blue cover
5. Gold lettering on the side in 16 or 18 pt (0.25 inch) stating: PhD 2009 COSTI E.M.


I will not be able to come to the premises so I wondered if I could pay by some online / telephone method and if the copies could be posted to my home address in London. How much would it cost me in total?


If you have any further queries, please do no hesitate to get back to me.


Kind regards,
Elliot Costi
