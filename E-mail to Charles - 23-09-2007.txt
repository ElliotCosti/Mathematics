Dear Charles,

I am trying to see if I can get the non-natural representation
code for SL to work in cross characteristic. However, I have come
up with a problem in a part of the code. In this piece of code, HE
has a normal p-subgroup SY. Should this not mean that it is
reducible?

To fill in the blanks, I am considering GL(3, 2) as a non-natural
representation of PSL(2, 7). HE is the image in GL(3, 2) of the
subgroup H of PSL(2, 7) that stabilises the first basis element of
the underlying vector space. Magma says that H is irreducible but
HE is not.

G := GL(3, 2);

a := G![0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1];
b := G![1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1];

HE := sub<G|a, b>;

c := G![1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0];

SY := sub<G|c>;

assert IsNormal(HE, SY);
assert IsIrreducible(HE);
