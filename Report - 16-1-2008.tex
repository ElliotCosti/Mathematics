\section{Reading}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory by James Humphreys - Chapters 2 and 3 of 7.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Wrote an algorithm to write a word in the generators for $\Omega^-(d, F)$, char $F \ne 2$ in a non-natural representation
\item Calcualted generators for $\Omega^-(d, F)$, char $F = 2$
\item Wrote algorithms to write a word in the generators for $\Omega^-(d, F)$, char $F = 2$ in both a natural and a non-natural representation
\item Wrote algorithms to write a word in the generators for $\Omega(d, F)$, $d$ odd, char $F \ne 2$ in both a natural and a non-natural representation
\item Wrote code to test and debug the above algorithms
\item Modified all non-natural representation algorithms so that they were able to work over non-natural representations of the same characteristic rather than the same field
\item Modified the Unitary group algorithms so that they ran faster
\item Assisted a colleague at Imperial with his problem
\item Modified {\tt MatrixPGroupWordInGen} so that it ran faster
\item Wrote 22 pages of a paper that will eventually be turned into a thesis
\item Started work on writing code to Construct algorithms to write an element of $\PSX(d, q)$ as an element of its generators by considering how the generators act on the projective points.
\item Timed all algorithms against various variables
\end{enumerate}

\section{Seminars}

\begin{enumerate}
\item I gave a Pure Maths Seminar based on my research
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Things To Be Done}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the complexity of the algorithms for which this has not yet been done

\item Continue with the $\PSX(d, q)$ work

\item Continue writing the paper

\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
